# Carrier - Asteroid Orbit // 3.19.5016u

Having beaten a mercenary outfit and taken their ship as prize, the **crew** (as far as I know) decided to scrap their stolen ship and make a blink gate out of it, using schematics provided by the **Monolith**. 

They then decide to head to a surely abandoned **asteroid** to retrieve a supposedly indestructable material for their "employeer", along with some wealth for themselves. 

The system is odd, with only gas giants surrounded by an ocean of moons. If there were rock planets in the system's history they've long been obliterated by the asteroids seeded with indestructable debris. Some quirk of the system's formation left many of the asteroids rich in trapped gasses and minerals, used in some esoteric manufacturing, that cost more to produce than to simply harvest. 

The asteroid you've been sent to was supposed to have been mined out years ago. The only thing remaining being rusted machinery and abandoned facilities.
